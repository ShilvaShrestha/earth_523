# Earth523 Lab 4

Today, we learnt how to use git, work both locally and remotely and to write a **RMarkdown**
RMarkdown can be helpful for :
1. embedding code chunks
2. creating pdf, html or word output
  + Presentation slides
3. include text, useful for writing paper

[Here is my github page](https://github.com/ShilvaShrestha/earth_523)

This is important

```{r car_analysis}
head(cars)
str(cars)

plot(cars)
max_speed <- max(cars$speed)

```
The average speed of the cars in the cars dataset is `r mean(cars$speed)`.The minimum speed is `r min(cars$speed)`. The maximum speed is `r max_speed`.
